            <h3>Do you need to have a supervisor before starting classes?</h3>
            <p>As of now (March'25), you do not need to have a supervisor beforehand in order to get accepted to the 
                M.Sc in Computing Science program at the UofA. You will get the chance 
                to name potential supervisors you are interested in working with in your application. 
                However, you are not required to ensure that any of them has agreed to supervise you 
                (although that definitely doesn't hurt!). It's a good idea to reach out to them before 
                deciding to name them in your application, but keep in mind that professors are usually 
                busy and may not be able to get back to you before the application deadline, so continue 
                with your application regardless. 
            </p>

            <h3>How do you look for supervisors <u>before</u> starting classes?</h3>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3oANa67Iq4" target="_blank">This video</a> says almost everything about this topic.
                <br><br>
                To summarize, the first thing you need to do is find out your <b>research area of interest</b>. Computing
                science is a huge field and has many different branches. You can use 
                <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/computing-science/research/research-areas/index.html" target="_blank">this website</a> 
                as a starting point for the UofA. Once you have a vague idea of the research areas you're interested in, start looking 
                up the professors working on that area. Chances are high that those professors will have public websites
                with a list of their recent publications, current research work, current students and most importantly, 
                a section dedicated to <b>potential students</b>. If you manage to find that, definitely go through all
                the information, especially the instructions for potential students regarding how to contact them. If you 
                would like to get a sense of what it would be like to work under a particular professor, a good 
                way to get an idea is to contact their current students.
                <br><br>
                <b><u>Side note:</u></b> You'll probably have to read a few papers before reaching out to supervisors. 
                <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1273445.1273458" target="_blank">This</a> might help ease your initiation 
                into academic literature.

            <h3>How do you look for supervisors <u>after</u> starting classes?</h3>
            <p>It's much easier to catch a professor's attention when you're there in person. If you already have potential
                professors in mind and they happen to be taking classes in the upcoming semesters, it's a good idea to enroll. 
                After enrolling, try your level best to put sincere effort into the coursework. If you make 
                a good impression in class, a professor is more likely to agree to supervise you (provided 
                they are looking for students), since they have seen first-hand that you are a 
                dedicated and hard working individual. <br><br>
                If they're not taking classes, don't be discouraged! Email them with your shiny new ualberta email 
                address, following the steps outlined in the previous answer. Try to attend the orientation and 
                fresher events organised during the first semester, as you might get the chance to talk to potential 
                supervisors in person. The mandatory course CMPUT 603 usually has a lecture where professors 
                looking for students will talk about their current research work and what kind of students they are
                looking for. 
            </p>
            <h3>Is there a deadline while looking for supervisors?</h3>
            <p>As of now (March'25), you need to find a supervisor before your first spring/summer semester at the UofA. That gives you two whole semesters
                to look for supervisors (provided you started in Fall). Realistically you get around one and a half 
                semesters, which is roughly around six and a half months. It's best to start looking as soon as you have
                an idea about your research areas of interest, to get a head start.
